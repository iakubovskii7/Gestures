# Data recording
Data was recorded February 2014.
Recorded gesture captures: 14 gestures * 3 variations * 6 repetitions * 31 subjects = 7812 touch gestures in total

# Preprocessing
The raw sensor data was checked and segmented. Coarse segmentation was based on the subject's marking of the end of the 
touch gesture. Further segmentation was based on the change in the gesture's intensity, that is, the summed pressure over 
all 64 channels. Parameters were optimized by visual inspection and kept constant for the whole data set.
